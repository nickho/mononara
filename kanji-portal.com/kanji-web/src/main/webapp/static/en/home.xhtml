            <p>The dictionary search now use the lucene indexes (like the kanji search). The same
                update were also done for the dictionary service. This is a minor update.

            <p>Here we go, a new version is online. The database is more stable and now i can focus on
                adding spellings and more vocabulary. I also need to tag the kanji for the JLPT level 3, 2 and 1
            </p>

            <p>The main upgrade was the auto import of kanji and meaning for ~6000 kanjis with tags.
                and references. I did some graphic cleaning in the same time. The rest services are also done
                with 3 entry points to work with Mononara
